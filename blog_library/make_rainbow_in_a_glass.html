<h1>How to Make a Rainbow in a Glass (Easy Science Experiment)</h1>

<p>
Imagine creating a bright, colorful rainbow right inside your home using just water, sugar, and food coloring. This rainbow in a glass experiment is a simple and visually exciting science activity that demonstrates how liquids with different densities behave. It is a perfect experiment for kids, students, and anyone who enjoys hands-on learning with vibrant results.
</p>

<p>
Not only does this project look beautiful, but it also teaches an important scientific concept in a fun and easy-to-understand way. You will learn how density affects how liquids settle and interact.
</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>
Before you begin, gather the following materials:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>4 clear glasses or cups</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Food coloring (red, yellow, green, and blue)</li>
    <li>A spoon for stirring</li>
    <li>A tall, clear glass for layering</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Colored Solutions</h2>

<p>
Fill each of the four glasses with the same amount of water. Add a different food coloring to each glass so that you have one red, one yellow, one green, and one blue solution. Stir well to make sure the colors mix evenly.
</p>

<h2>Step 2: Add Sugar in Layers</h2>

<p>
Add different amounts of sugar to each colored glass to create liquids with different densities.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Red glass: Add 3 tablespoons of sugar</li>
    <li>Yellow glass: Add 2 tablespoons of sugar</li>
    <li>Green glass: Add 1 tablespoon of sugar</li>
    <li>Blue glass: Add no sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>
Stir each glass carefully until all the sugar has completely dissolved. This step is very important for proper layering.
</p>

<h2>Step 3: Layer the Colors</h2>

<p>
Take the tall clear glass and begin layering the colored liquids. Slowly pour the red solution into the bottom of the glass first. Next, gently add the yellow solution, followed by the green, and finally the blue.
</p>

<p>
Pour each layer very slowly over the back of a spoon to prevent the liquids from mixing too quickly.
</p>

<h2>Step 4: Watch the Rainbow Form</h2>

<p>
If poured correctly, you will see four clear layers of color stacked on top of each other, forming a beautiful rainbow inside the glass.
</p>

<h2>Why Does This Experiment Work?</h2>

<p>
This experiment works because of density, which measures how much mass is packed into a given volume of liquid. The more sugar dissolved in the water, the denser the liquid becomes.
</p>

<p>
The red liquid is the densest because it has the most sugar, while the blue liquid is the least dense because it contains no sugar. When you pour the liquids from the most dense to the least dense, they settle in layers instead of mixing together.
</p>

<h2>Fun Variations to Try</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Add more colors by adjusting sugar levels for extra layers.</li>
    <li>Use honey, dish soap, or oil to create additional density levels.</li>
    <li>Shine a flashlight through the glass to create a glowing rainbow effect.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safety Note</h2>

<p>
This experiment is completely safe to perform, but the final rainbow liquid is not meant for drinking due to the high sugar content and food coloring.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
The rainbow in a glass experiment is a simple yet powerful way to explore density and liquid behavior. It combines science, creativity, and visual beauty into one engaging activity. This project is ideal for classrooms, home learning, science fairs, or just a fun afternoon experiment.
</p>

<p>
Try this experiment today and enjoy creating your own colorful rainbow indoors.

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>1. Why do the colors stay in separate layers?</strong></p>
        <p>The colors stay separated because each liquid has a different density based on how much sugar it contains.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>2. What happens if the liquids mix together?</strong></p>
        <p>If poured too quickly, the layers can mix and the rainbow effect will not appear clearly.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>3. Can I use other liquids instead of sugar water?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, you can use honey, dish soap, or oil to create alternate density layers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>4. Is this experiment suitable for young children?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes, this is a kid-friendly science experiment with adult supervision during pouring.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <p><strong>5. Can the rainbow in a glass be stored for later?</strong></p>
        <p>It can be kept for a short time, but the layers may slowly mix over several hours.</p>
